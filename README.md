# Token-creation
This project demonstrates the creation of a basic token using a smart contract written in Solidity. which can be deployed with the help of a smart contract. The purpose of this project is to provide beginners with a starting point to understand token creation and how to interact with a token contract.

# Description
The project consists of a Solidity contract named MyToken.It is a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain
The contract implements a simple token with two essential functions: Mint and Burn. The Mint function increases the token balance of a specified address, while the Burn function decreases the token balance.

To run this project, follow the steps below:

* Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Remix, an online Solidity IDE, installed or access it through your web browser at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
* Open Remix and create a new file with a .sol extension (e.g., peta.sol).
* Copy and paste the code from the peta.sol file in this repository into the new file you created in Remix.
* Compile the code in Remix by navigating to the "Solidity Compiler" tab and clicking on the "Compile peta.sol" button.
Once the code is successfully compiled, go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
Select the MyToken contract from the dropdown menu and click on the "Deploy" button to deploy the contract.
Usage
After deploying the contract, you can interact with it using the following functions:

Mint(address _address, uint _value): Increases the token balance of the specified _address by _value.
Burn(address _address, uint _value): Decreases the token balance of the specified _address by _value.
Please refer to the video tutorial provided in the previous section for a step-by-step guide on how to interact with the contract.
